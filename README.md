# Work in progress 
# Greener-BlazorServer
Hobbyct to explore firebase and Blazor framework. Full-stack application that uses Firebase and Blazor server.

## Description
As a crazy plant lady, I needed some assistance in managing the cutting, fertilization, and watering schedules for my plant collection. This is where Greener came to life. It is an application that can track last watering, cutting, and fertilization dates for each plant.

## Runing the app

For now application can be run locally by cloning the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/MistyDoe/Greener-BlazorServer
```

then navigate to folder named Greener, and run the application using 

```
dotnet run
```
 
 The application can be accessed at https://localhost:7048/
